## ‚ùì **Q&A Session**

### **Common Questions & Answers**

**Q: "How much does each blockchain transaction cost?"**
A: "On Sepolia testnet, transactions are free. On mainnet, costs are typically $1-5 per transaction, which is minimal compared to the value of transparency and authenticity verification."

**Q: "What happens if someone loses their MetaMask wallet?"**
A: "Data remains on blockchain permanently. Users can recover access with seed phrase, or admin can help verify identity for data access."

**Q: "How do you prevent fake data entry?"**
A: "We use multi-checkpoint verification, admin approval system, and blockchain immutability. Once data is verified and stored, it cannot be altered."

**Q: "Can this scale to thousands of users?"**
A: "Yes, our architecture is designed for scale. Blockchain handles data integrity, while our backend APIs handle high-volume requests efficiently."

**Q: "What about users without technical knowledge?"**
A: "The interface is designed to be user-friendly. We provide training and support, and the MetaMask integration is simplified with clear instructions."
